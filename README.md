# SWIP
This repo is for the [Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus](https://cacr.iu.edu/projects/swip/index.php) (SWIP) project. It contains no Pegasus source code; rather, it's used for issue tracking, information sharing, and contains a few files related to (SWAMP) static analysis of SWIP-related Pegasus code. Source code developed by the project will be contributed to https://github.com/pegasus-isi/pegasus, https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/orca5, and https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/chaos-jungle.
